# Malak Alnajjar - Hybrid Engineer Portfolio

A creative, modern, and non-traditional portfolio website showcasing the intersection of Telecommunication Engineering and AI & Data Science.

## 🎯 Concept

This portfolio is designed as a "Smart Network System" where:
- **Telecom** = the infrastructure (signals, fiber, routing)
- **AI & Data** = the intelligence layer (optimization, prediction, analytics)

The design metaphor is subtly integrated throughout the layout, section naming, and micro-interactions.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Sections

1. **Hero Section** - Animated network background with hybrid identity messaging
2. **Hybrid Timeline** - Unified career journey showing how telecom and AI experiences interconnect
3. **Network & Communication Systems** - Telecom projects with engineering focus
4. **AI-Driven Intelligence Layer** - Data science projects with model/method/output structure
5. **Fusion Projects** - Creative intersection where telecom meets AI
6. **Certifications & Badges** - Interactive certification cards with hover effects
7. **Skills Map** - Visual representation showing overlap between Telecom & AI
8. **Leadership & Impact** - IEEE involvement, volunteering, and recommendations

### Design Highlights

- Dark modern theme with gradient accents
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Responsive design for all devices
- Interactive network visualization in hero section
- Clean typography with Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
