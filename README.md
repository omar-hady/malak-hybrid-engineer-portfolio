# Malak Alnajjar - Hybrid Engineer Portfolio

A creative, modern, and non-traditional portfolio website showcasing the intersection of Telecommunication Engineering and AI & Data Science.

## 🎯 Concept

This portfolio is designed as a "Smart Network System" where:
- **Telecom** = the infrastructure (signals, fiber, routing)
- **AI & Data** = the intelligence layer (optimization, prediction, analytics)

The design metaphor is subtly integrated throughout the layout, section naming, and micro-interactions.
